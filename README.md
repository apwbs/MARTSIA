# Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for Interoperating Applications

This is the master and principal GitHub repo of the Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for Interoperating 
Applications (MARTSIA) project. From here you will be redirected to all the available repos.
The MARTSIA approach is presented in two papers. The first one is 
"[MARTSIA: Enabling Data Confidentiality for Blockchain-based Process 
Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17977)" accepted at 
[EDOC 2023](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/conf/?lang=en). The DOI will be published when available. 
The second paper about MARTSIA, that extends the work done in the first one, is 
"[Enabling Data Confidentiality with Public Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03791)". This journal version has 
been submitted at [ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (ACM-TOIT)](https://dl.acm.org/journal/toit), and it is currently
under review.
